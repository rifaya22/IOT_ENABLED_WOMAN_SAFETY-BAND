# Project Name
MANUAL AND AUTOMATIC IOT ENABLED WOMAN SAFETY BAND

## Description
This project is a **woman safety band** that sends an **SOS message** with your **live location** using **GSM and GPS modules** when the button is pressed or in emergency situations.

## Features
- Manual SOS button  
- Sends SMS with location  
- Real-time alerts using GSM module  
- Easy to wear and use  

## Components
- Arduino Uno  
- GSM Module (SIM800L)  
- GPS Module  
- Push Button  
- Battery & Enclosure  

## Installation / Usage
1. Open `GPS.ino` in Arduino IDE.  
2. Connect your Arduino and moduleS.
3. Upload the code to Arduino.  
4. Press the button to test the SOS functionality.  

## Challenges Faced
- Calibrating accelerometer for emergency detection  
- Setting thresholds for normal vs sudden movement  
- Communication reliability with GSM module
